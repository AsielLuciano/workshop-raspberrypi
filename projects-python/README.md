# Using Rapsberry Pi with PubNub

## Getting started with PubNub

- [Setting up PubNub Python libs](../README.md#setting-up-pubnub-python-lib)


## Pi Projects with Sensors

To set up your Raspberry Pi, read [Setting up Raspberry Pi](../README.md).

- Motion Sensor
  * [Motion Sensor](../examples-python/MotionSensor/Motionsensor.py) The basic code that detects motion and sends a notification to a browser or a mobile phone.
  * [Motion Sensor and Range Finder](../examples-python/MotionSensor/Motionsensor_rangefinder.py) This program lets you notify a range finder when you detect motion.
  * [Spicam](../examples-python/MotionSensor/SpiCamMotion.py) This example switches on the camera to capture a picture when motion is detected.
- [Ultrasonic Rangefinder](../examples-python/RangeFinder/rangefinder.py)
