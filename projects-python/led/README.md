# Using LED: Hello World of Hardware

## Wiring an LED

To get started with wires and breadboard, let's make an LED light up by simply wiring to the 3.3V.

### What You Need

- Raspberry Pi 2 (Set up properly. See [Setting up Raspberry Pi](../README.md))
- 1 LED light (Somewhere around 1.9V - 3.2V)
- 1 Resistor 200Ω ~ 270Ω
- Breadboard
- 2 M-to-F jumper wires, 2 colors

### Assemble the Circuit

## Controlling the LED with Python

When you program the LED, re-connect the 3.3V wire into a one of GPIO pin. In this example,
I am using the GPIO-4 (Pin 7).
